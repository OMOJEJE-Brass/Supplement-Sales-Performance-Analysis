# "Supplement Sales Performance Analysis & Insights Dashboard"

## Introduction
##### This analysis explores weekly sales performance data for various supplement products across multiple platforms and locations. The goal is to gain actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, customer returns, and the impact of discounts on purchase behavior. By examining key metrics such as total revenue, units sold, return rates, and platform-specific performance, this report aims to identify growth opportunities, inefficiencies, and patterns that can support data-driven decision-making. 
##### The dataset, titled "Supplement_Sales_Weekly_Expanded", includes information such as product categories, pricing, discounts applied, and the number of units returned. Through the use of Excel PivotTables, charts, and slicers, an interactive dashboard has been developed to provide a clear overview of business performance and assist stakeholders in strategic planning.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate weekly supplement sales performance across various product categories, platforms, and locations. By leveraging Excel's data analysis tools, the project seeks to uncover trends, measure key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide insights that support strategic decision-making in sales, marketing, and operations.

Insights
1.	 March had the highest revenue of ₦2,271,026.40, January and March had the highest units sold: 64,780 and 65,398, respectively. April had the lowest revenue of ₦1,685,662.30 and September had the lowest units sold of 50,204. Additionally, from April to July, revenue and unit sales were generally below average. Then, from October to December, the performance shows a relatively stable trend (~₦1.8M–₦1.85M revenue).
2.	Products with the highest revenue (e.g., Biotin, Zinc, Pre-Workout) also rank high in units sold, suggesting strong price-to-volume consistency and healthy demand. The small variance in units sold indicates that pricing strategies or product positioning, rather than quantity alone, may be the key revenue differentiator. Vitamin and Mineral supplements dominate both revenue and unit sales, indicating strong consumer preference and market demand.
3.	The “High Discount” group (11%–20%) contributes the highest share of both units sold (39.5%) and revenue (39.4%). The “Higher Discount” group (21% and above) (presumably deeper cuts) contributes only 17.5% of revenue, despite being the second-highest in discount level. Low (0%–5%) and Normal-Discount (6%–10%) groups account for 43% of total revenue, nearly matching that of the High-Discount tier.
4.	a.  iHerb recorded the highest Units Sold (225,427) and the highest Revenue (₦7,855,261.05).This represents a strong market share, contributing ~34% of total revenue and ~34% of total units sold. Amazon follows closely with 220,623 units sold and ₦7,669,451.78 revenue, contributing ~33% of revenue.  Amazon shows slightly higher returns than iHerb, but the difference is marginal.  Walmart has the lowest sales (212,428 units) and lowest revenue (₦7,388,567.62) among the three, contributing about 32% of total revenue.  It also has the lowest number of returns (2,128 units), which could indicate better customer satisfaction or fewer issues. Total Returns: 6,714 units across all platforms. Return distribution is fairly even, with each platform accounting for roughly 31% to 34% of total returns. There is no significant variance in return volume between platforms.
b. Canada leads in both Units Sold (226,053) and Revenue (₦7,848,579.73), accounting for approximately 34% of total revenue and 34% of total units sold. The UK ranks second with 221,237 units sold and ₦7,703,960.34 revenue, contributing about 33% of total revenue. Total returns across all locations = 6,714 units. However, the UK also recorded the highest returns (2,327 units) among all locations.
5.	The overall return rate across all products is approximately 1.02% (0.01019624), which is relatively low, with Vitamin C having the highest return rate of 1.12%. The overall return rate across all categories is 1.02%, which aligns closely with product-level findings, but Hydration has the highest which is 1.07% return rate.
6.	March (65,398 units) and January (64,780 units) have the highest sales. These peaks might be linked to seasonal events, e.g., New Year resolutions (January) and pre-summer health/fitness demand (March). September (50,204 units), June (50,555 units), and December (50,515 units) record the lowest sales. December’s drop could indicate that customers purchase earlier in the year, or there’s less demand around holiday seasons. Sales between May and August show moderate demand, with values between 52,000–55,000 units. 
Quarterly Trend: Q1 (Jan–Mar): Strongest sales (187,618 units). Q4 (Oct–Dec): Weakest sales (156,272 units).
7.	Biotin (6.49%), BCAA (6.39%), and Zinc (6.47%) have the highest total revenue contribution across all platforms, indicating they are consistently popular regardless of sales channel. Magnesium (5.94%) and Melatonin (6.10%) contribute the least among the listed products, suggesting lower demand or lower pricing. iHerb (34.28%) accounts for the largest share of total revenue, slightly outperforming Amazon (33.47%) and Walmart (32.25%).
Conclusion
The analysis of sales, revenue, discounts, platforms, locations, and return rates provides clear insights into business performance:
1.	Sales and Revenue Trends:
March achieved the highest revenue (₦2,271,026.40), with January and March leading in units sold (64,780 and 65,398 respectively). The period from April to July experienced below-average performance, while October to December showed stable revenue (~₦1.8M–₦1.85M). Q1 (Jan–Mar) emerged as the strongest quarter, whereas Q4 (Oct–Dec) was the weakest in terms of total sales (156,272 units).
2.	Product Performance:
Products like Biotin, Zinc, and Pre-Workout are top performers in both revenue and units sold, reflecting strong consumer demand and effective pricing strategies. Vitamin and Mineral supplements dominate the market, contributing significantly to overall revenue.
3.	Discount Impact:
The High Discount group (11%–20%) drives the largest share of both units sold (39.5%) and revenue (39.4%), proving that moderate discounts are effective. However, deeper discounts (21% and above) contribute only 17.5% of revenue, suggesting diminishing returns on heavy discounting.
4.	Platforms & Locations:
iHerb leads in revenue (₦7,855,261.05) and units sold (225,427), accounting for ~34% of total revenue. Amazon follows closely, while Walmart trails with 32% of total revenue. Geographically, Canada leads in both revenue and units sold, while the UK records slightly higher return volumes.
5.	Returns:
The overall return rate of 1.02% is low, indicating strong product quality and customer satisfaction. Vitamin C has the highest return rate (1.12%), and categories like Hydration (1.07%) have slightly above-average returns.
6.	Seasonality:
Sales peaks in January and March suggest seasonal demand linked to New Year health goals and pre-summer fitness trends. September, June, and December are the weakest months, possibly due to seasonal slumps or pre-holiday shifts in spending.
7.	Platform-Product Performance:
Biotin (6.49%), BCAA (6.39%), and Zinc (6.47%) are the top revenue generators across platforms. iHerb outperforms both Amazon and Walmart in total revenue and unit share, showing it is the preferred channel for consumers.
Recommendations
1.	Leverage Seasonal Peaks:
•	Increase marketing campaigns and product availability before January and March to capitalize on peak sales periods.
•	Launch targeted promotions in Q1 to boost revenue further.
2.	Optimize Discounts:
•	Maintain discount levels between 11%–20%, as they yield the highest sales and revenue contribution.
•	Avoid deep discounting (21%+), as it leads to lower revenue share without significant unit sales growth.
3.	Focus on Best-Selling Products:
•	Continue prioritizing Biotin, Zinc, and Pre-Workout in advertising and inventory planning.
•	Introduce bundle promotions for Vitamin and Mineral supplements, leveraging their strong market demand.
4.	Platform Strategy:
•	Strengthen partnerships with iHerb while exploring strategies to boost Amazon’s revenue share.
•	For Walmart, focus on targeted promotions to close the performance gap.
5.	Return Rate Monitoring:
•	Investigate the slightly higher return rate of Vitamin C (1.12%) and address potential issues (e.g., product quality or marketing misalignment).
6.	Geographic Focus:
•	Invest in Canada and UK markets, which drive the majority of sales.
•	Evaluate strategies for improving customer satisfaction in the UK, where returns are slightly higher.
7.	Long-Term Trends:
•	Develop a quarterly sales strategy focusing on Q2 and Q4, which currently show weaker performance.
•	Use data-driven promotions to even out seasonal dips.
